This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(flextable)
```

```{r}
ft <- flextable(airquality[ sample.int(10),])
ft <- add_header_row(ft,
  colwidths = c(4, 2),
  values = c("Air quality", "Time")
)
ft <- theme_vanilla(ft)
ft <- add_footer_lines(ft, "Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.")
ft <- color(ft, part = "footer", color = "#666666")
ft <- set_caption(ft, caption = "New York Air Quality Measurements")
ft
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
